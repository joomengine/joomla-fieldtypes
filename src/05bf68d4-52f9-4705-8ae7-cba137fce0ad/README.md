### JCB! Field Type
# Repeatable

> Form fields with repeatable rows of inputs.

Provides a modal interface containing rows of form fields that you define. Users can add as many entries as needed, with each row repeating the specified field set. This field type relies on a jQuery-based JavaScript file for its dynamic functionality.
