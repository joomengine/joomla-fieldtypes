### JCB! Field Type
# Calendar

> Text box for entry of a date.

The calendar form field type provides a text box for entry of a date. An icon next to the text box provides a link to a pop-up calendar, which can also be used to enter the date value. If the field has a saved value this is shown in the text box.
